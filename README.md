# Command line test tool for BTS7960 pwm connected via RPi GPIO

What is this

This ` python ` srcipt is a small test tool to explore how BTS7960 or similar PWM controler works if connected with Raspberry Pi via GPIO ports.

The goal of this project is to play with the PWM as simply as possible using just a terminal. You can use it just to test with an engine but you can use it with oscilloscope as well to discover how duty-cycles in real life work. It's only up to you.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Get ` python3-rpi.gpio ` if you don't already have it.

3. Wire your PWM controler according to its documentation.

## Usage

Just run the script without any command-line argument.
